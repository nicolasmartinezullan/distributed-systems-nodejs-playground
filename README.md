# Distributed Systems with Node JS Playground

Playground created to understand better the concepts behind [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus#readme) and [Democracy.js](https://github.com/goldfire/democracy.js#readme).

## Notes

- This playground is based on a demo presented in the Nordic.js 2019 by James Simpson.

## Requirements

- Development server to run the client. I use the Visual Studio Code extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## Use

- Install the dependencies via `yarn install` or `npm install`.
- `yarn start` to run the Load Balancer and the 4 servers.
- Lunch the index.html using a development local server.
- Open 2 or more clients in the browser and start clicking on each screen to see the events in the other screens.
